I've updated an app that I made for AvX Dice Masters to include Uncanny X-Men, Yu-Gi-Oh and D&D*, and I plan to keep it updated as card lists become available.

I use this to randomize my games because I keep my cards alphabetized, so shuffling is inconvenient.

Please use it if you find it useful, and feel free to post feedback and bugs on this thread!
